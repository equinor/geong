<h3>Architectural Elements: Proportional Contribution</h3>

<p>
    The five elements detailed below have been identified as the key building
    blocks of deep water reservoirs. There are, of course, examples of
    discovered fields and studied depositional systems that include other
    processes and element types, as well as a host of literature on niche
    aspects of sedimentology/stratigraphy in the deep water realm. For the
    purposes of this study, and indeed for pragmatic subsurface prediction in an
    exploration context, we suggest that the five elements below form the key
    sources of reservoir and heterogeneity "99% of the time".

<p>
    Consider these architectural elements as the primary building blocks of a
    geological "Lego" set that can be stacked to reconstruct geological models
    and scenarios. Stacking these elements in varying proportions using your
    data-led understanding of the prospect or lead provides a means to then
    quantify any given scenario using this tool.

    The output will only be as good as your geological model in terms of
    predictive outcomes, but the key purpose is to quantify your geological
    rationale and so pin the N:G probability distribution to reasoned ...
